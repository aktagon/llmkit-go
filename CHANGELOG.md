## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5] — 2026-05-05

Note: this release contains a behaviour change typical of a minor bump. It shipped as a patch because tagging followed the existing `v0.1.x` cadence; the practical impact on `go get -u` users is the same either way. Pin to `v0.1.4` if you need the prior (broken) behaviour.

### Fixed

- `WithThinkingBudget(N)` now produces `{"thinking": {"budget_tokens": N, "type": "enabled"}}` for Anthropic, instead of a flat `"thinking.budget_tokens"` key the server silently ignored. **Behaviour change**: callers that already passed `WithThinkingBudget` will now actually engage Anthropic extended thinking on supported models — expect higher latency and additional reasoning tokens in `Response.Tokens.Reasoning`. No code change required to opt in. To opt out, omit the option.
- Provider option overrides with dotted JSON keys (e.g. Google's `thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget`) are now correctly nested. Previously such options were dropped silently.

### Added

- `setNestedField` and `mergeIntoParent` internal helpers shared between options and structured-output handling.

## [0.1.4] — earlier
