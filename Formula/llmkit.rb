    <<~EOS
      llmkit provides unified access to multiple LLM providers.

      Set your API keys as environment variables:
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
        export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-key"

      You can add these to your shell profile (~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, etc.)
      to make them permanent.

      Use 'llmkit --help' to see available commands and options.
